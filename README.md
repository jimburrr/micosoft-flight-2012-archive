MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS
MICROSOFT FLIGHT 
These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft
•	updates,
•	supplements,
•	Internet-based services, and
•	support services
for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.
By using the software, you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the software. Instead, return it to the retailer for a refund or credit. If you cannot obtain a refund there, contact Microsoft or the Microsoft affiliate serving your country for information about Microsoft’s refund policies. See www.microsoft.com/worldwide. In the United States and Canada, call (800) MICROSOFT or see www.microsoft.com/info/nareturns.htm.
If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below for each license you acquire.
•	OVERVIEW. The software is licensed on a per copy per device basis. A hardware partition or blade is considered to be a separate device.
•	INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.
•	One Copy per Device. You may install one copy of the software on one device. That device is the “licensed device.”
•	Licensed Device. You may use one copy of the software on the licensed device at a time.
•	Portable Device. You may install another copy on a portable device for use by the single primary user of the licensed device.
•	Third Party Programs. The software contains third party programs. The terms that come with those programs apply, unless otherwise stated in those terms.
•	ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.
•	Font Components. While the software is running, you may use its fonts to display and print content. You may only
•	embed fonts in content as permitted by the embedding restrictions in the fonts; and
•	temporarily download them to a printer or other output device to help print content.
•	INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the software. It may change or cancel them at any time. 
•	SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not
•	work around any technical limitations in the software;
•	reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;
•	make more copies of the software than specified in this agreement or allowed by applicable law, despite this limitation;
•	publish the software for others to copy;
•	use the software in any way that is against the law;
•	rent, lease or lend the software; or
•	use the software for commercial software hosting services.
•	BACKUP COPY.
•	Electronic Download. If you acquired and downloaded the software online, you may make one copy of the software on a disc or other media in order to install the software on the licensed device. You may also use it to reinstall the software on the licensed device.
•	DOCUMENTATION. Any person that has valid access to your licensed device or internal network may copy and use the documentation for your internal, reference purposes.
•	TRANSFER TO A THIRD PARTY. The first user of the software may make a one-time transfer of the software and this agreement by transferring the genuine proof of license directly to a third party. Before any permitted transfer, the other party must agree that this agreement applies to the transfer and use of the software. The first user must remove the software before transferring it separately from the licensed device. The first user may not retain any copies of the software. 
•	EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting.
•	SUPPORT SERVICES. Microsoft provides support services for the software as described at www.support.microsoft.com/common/international.aspx.
•	ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement (including the warranty below), any addendum or amendment included with the software, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.
•	APPLICABLE LAW.
•	United States. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.
•	Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.
•	LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your state or country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your state or country if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so.
•	LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. You can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to the amount you paid for the software. You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages.
This limitation applies to
•	anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
•	claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if
•	repair, replacement or a refund for the software does not fully compensate you for any losses; or
•	Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.
Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. They also may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
 
************************************************************************************
LIMITED WARRANTY
•	LIMITED WARRANTY. If you follow the instructions, the software will perform substantially as described in the Microsoft materials that you receive in or with the software.
•	TERM OF WARRANTY; WARRANTY RECIPIENT; LENGTH OF ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES. The limited warranty covers the software for one year after acquired by the first user. If you receive supplements, updates, or replacement software during that year, they will be covered for the remainder of the warranty or 30 days, whichever is longer. If the first user transfers the software, the remainder of the warranty will apply to the recipient.
To the extent permitted by law, any implied warranties, guarantees or conditions last only during the term of the limited warranty. Some states do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so these limitations may not apply to you. They also might not apply to you because some countries may not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty, guarantee or condition lasts.
•	EXCLUSIONS FROM WARRANTY. This warranty does not cover problems caused by your acts (or failures to act), the acts of others, or events beyond Microsoft’s reasonable control.
•	REMEDY FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY. Microsoft will repair or replace the software at no charge. If Microsoft cannot repair or replace it, Microsoft will refund the amount shown on your receipt for the software. It will also repair or replace supplements, updates and replacement software at no charge. If Microsoft cannot repair or replace them, it will refund the amount you paid for them, if any. You must uninstall the software and return any media and other associated materials to Microsoft with proof of purchase to obtain a refund. These are your only remedies for breach of the limited warranty.
•	CONSUMER RIGHTS NOT AFFECTED. You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws, which this agreement cannot change.
•	WARRANTY PROCEDURES. You need proof of purchase for warranty service.
•	United States and Canada. For warranty service or information about how to obtain a refund for software acquired in the United States and Canada, contact Microsoft at
•	(800) MICROSOFT;
•	Microsoft Customer Service and Support, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399; or

•	Outside United States, Canada, Europe, Middle East and Africa. If you acquired the software outside the United States, Canada, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, contact the Microsoft affiliate serving your country (see www.microsoft.com/worldwide).
•	NO OTHER WARRANTIES. The limited warranty is the only direct warranty from Microsoft. Microsoft gives no other express warranties, guarantees or conditions. Where allowed by your local laws, Microsoft excludes implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. If your local laws give you any implied warranties, guarantees or conditions, despite this exclusion, your remedies are described in the Remedy for Breach of Warranty clause above, to the extent permitted by your local laws.
•	LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY. The Limitation on and Exclusion of Damages clause above applies to breaches of this limited warranty.
This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state. You may also have other rights which vary from country to country.
